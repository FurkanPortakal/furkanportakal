# 🚀Hello Devs

## 😎 Furkan's Github Profile
I am Furkan, future frontend developer.I mostly use React & NodeJS in my side projects.
You can check out some of my projects and if you got any questions you can reach out in the links below.  
🌱I’m currently learning NodeJs, GAN, NLP.

## 📌 What programming languages I like

As a frontend developer most of my time I write JavaScript. But in my free time I am trying to build some projects in the backend as well. And when it comes to backend I like to organize my code. Because of that I like Java as well.
